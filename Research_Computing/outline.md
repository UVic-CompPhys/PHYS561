# Outline for fall 2023 session

## Theory/lecture
* Large scale computations
    - what is possible
    - challenges from the user perspective, dealing with large data
* Tips and tricks for computing and organizing digital work generally $\rightarrow$ `Class_notes....`
* Reproducability of science and preservation of capabilities
    - the key role of Docker to accomplish these goals, and 
    - how interestingly the latter (reservation of capabilities) may become less important or even obsolete through ChatGPT

## Practical part
In the practical part I want to touch on three topics
* Docker `jupydoc` as an example how to use Docker always (other examples `NuDocker`, [Astrohub](https://astrohub.uvic.ca) 
* ChatGPT, Git CoPilot
* accelerate your daily life
    - vectorization
    - threading 
    - caching


### Specific plan
* start with scinet jupyter
* jupydoc, show the ChtGPT thread
* use jupydoc to do vectorizatin example with ChtGPT
* introduce CoPilot and do the Pendulum problem using the ipython command line in jupydoc instance
* talk about threading and caching by example of he dir_analyser tools
