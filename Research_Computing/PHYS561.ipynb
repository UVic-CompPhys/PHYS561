    "#  Research computing - tools and resources \n",

    "#### Disclaimer\n",
    "* This 1.5hr module is intended to give you an overview of tools, resources and best practice experience. We do not have enough time to go into detail. If there is interest to follow-up any of the topics covered today in more detail, let the course coordinator know. \n",

    "### Components of research computing\n",
    "It is useful to distinguish clearly different components of research computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "Data is generated all the time when experiments or simulations are carried out. Confronting both with each other or with models involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* move, store, archive data\n",
    "* analyse data \n",
    "* model data\n",
    "* statistics (see below)\n",
    "* visualise data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "If we understand the physics then the **correct** (need to talk about that more ...) solution of the **appropriate** laws of nature, such as the _Conservation Laws_ of energy, momentum, mass, charge, etc, should resemble aspects of the real world as revealed through observational data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world problems have some challenges though:\n",
    "\n",
    "* multi-physics: include simultaneously different physics components, such as conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy as well as the Maxwell equations for a magneto-hydrodynamics problem\n",
    "* multi-scale: processes on vastly different temporal and spatial scales are simultaneously important and interacting\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical simulations combine the above challenges in ways impossible with purely analytical approaches. The simulations of high quality are numerical experiments that reveal the complex and non-linear behaviour of the appropriate combination of physics laws. This approach provides scientific insight in ways that complement traditional theory and physical experimental.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** models and simulations are different things!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modeling\n",
    "In order to break down complexity physicists often try to _model_ physics processes based on experimental of numerical simulation data. Modeling of data involves a lot of statics, fitting and ideally the model is physics based. More recently powerful models are derived from machine learning approaches. This is clearly an important emerging field, with lots of potential and interesting knowledge theory challenges; for example the recently raised [concern about reproducibility crisis of ML research](https://www.hpcwire.com/2019/02/19/machine-learning-reproducability-crisis-science/). Keep critically tuned into that conversation!\n",

    "* integrating a function or differential equation\n",

    "* solving a linear algebra problem with many variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, these days there are lots of really good _canned_ solutions, e.g. for FFTs. But there is [scipy.fftpack.fft](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fftpack.fft.html#scipy.fftpack.fft) and [numpy.fft.fft](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.fft.fft.html#numpy.fft.fft) - which one to use?). It is useful to undertstand the underlying algotithms, and [Numerical Recipes](http://voyager.library.uvic.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=687673) is still the foundational starting point.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Symbolic computing\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the availability of powerful simulation codes and libraries to rapidly deploy proven methods in numerical analysis, from time to time we need to be able to work with complicated mathematics in an analytical fashion. The laws of physics come in the language of mathematics, and we need to _speak_ that language to understand physics and to write down new physics insights. Symbolic computing is a powerful way to support that. To get started consult the Python module [Sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html).\n",
